# Calculate Texel Density

The Calculate TD function is used to analyze the texel density of objects or selected faces. This feature is essential for ensuring consistent texture detail and scale across your models, especially for game assets or high-fidelity renders.

If the object is in Edit Mode, the calculation will be performed only on selected faces. Otherwise, the operator processes the entire object. This flexibility allows for both localized and global texel density analysis.
